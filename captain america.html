        <h1>4-F Forever?</h1><br>
        <p>Envious of his friend Bucky Barnes’ military enlistment, and undeterred by his own multiple rejections by the U.S. Army, physical weakling Steve Rogers made one more attempt to join the march of men to fight for their country in the dark days of World War II. Rogers’ valiant wish to fight bullies wherever they were grabbed the attention of scientist Dr. Abraham Erskine, and he handpicked the idealistic young man for the Army’s Super-Soldier program under his supervision.</p><br>
        <img src="images\c\c1.jpg"><br>
        <p>Though Rogers learned of Erskine’s disastrous previous attempts to realize a super-soldier, Germany’s so-called “Red Skull,” he braved the process and emerged from it a new man. With a powerful body and heightened speed and reflexes, Rogers faced his first challenge when forced to chase down Dr. Erskine’s assassin immediately following the experiment. In doing so, he also learned of the involvement of Hydra, the Nazi science division, in the doctor’s murder.</p><br>
        <img src="images\c\c2.jpg"><br>
        <p>The Army moved swiftly to create a colorful, star-spangled persona for Steve Rogers they called “Captain America,” and put him on a tour to sell war bonds. Chafing at what he felt was inaction, Rogers jumped at the chance to join the real fighting when he received news of the capture of his friend Barnes’ army division and rushed to rescue the soldiers. Upon the successful completion of the unplanned mission—and a brief meeting with the Red Skull himself—Rogers determined his path as a one-man fighting force.</p><br>
        <h1>The Right Tools</h1><br>
        <p>As Captain America, Steve Rogers carries a nearly indestructible shield fashioned from the rare Wakandan metal known as vibranium. Designed and crafted by genius inventor Howard Stark during World War II, the shield is a perfectly balanced instrument capable of withstanding intense stress and damage, yet also able to be thrown as an offensive weapon that rebounds back to its owner. Rogers maintains the shield as an almost constant companion after it was recovered from the wreckage of the Red Skull’s airplane, as it has become a symbol of strength to all those who recognize Captain America as the country’s defender.</p><br>
        <img src="images\c\c3.jpg"><br>
        <p>Rogers is also well-versed in the use of firearms, though he rarely carries or uses them in modern times. His famous Captain America suit and helmet have been updated more than once since the 1940s, and offers him some protection against the elements and enemies alike.</p><br>
        <h1>Axis of Evil</h1><br>
        <p>Steve Rogers’ first real enemy took the form of Johann Schmidt, a German scientist and wartime leader of the Nazi science division, Hydra. Schmidt became known as the Red Skull after a failed attempt to augment himself using Dr. Erskine’s super-soldier serum devolved his features into a crimson, skull-like countenance. His obsession with power led him to gain possession of the Tesseract, an otherworldly power source of unparalleled energy, and split off of Hydra from Hitler’s forces. The Red Skull met his match, though, in Captain America. The hero dogged the villain throughout the war until Schmidt’s apparent demise in his own aircraft high above the North Atlantic.</p><br>
        <img src="images\c\c4.jpg"><br>
        <p>Arnim Zola, a scientist under the Red Skull’s command, managed to survive the war by supposedly allying himself with the allies and the newly created S.H.I.E.L.D.; but in reality, he kept the dream of Hydra alive all the while. When his own death approached, Zola transferred his consciousness into a S.H.I.E.L.D. computer to continue to be a thorn in Captain America’s side in the present.</p><br>
        <p>Other modern-day menaces for Steve Rogers include Asgardian god of mischief Loki, mercenary and martial artist Georges Batroc, and weapons dealer Brock Rumlow, AKA Crossbones.</p><br>
        <p>Captain America has also come face to face with the fearsome threat of Thanos, doing all he can to stop the Titan in his quest to end half the life in the universe.</p><br>
        <h1>Lasting Friendships</h1><hr>
        <p>Steve Rogers’ forthright attitude and positive disposition has attracted a select group of people into his inner circle of friends. His longest companion is James Buchanan “Bucky” Barnes, who Rogers met in his Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood in New York and formed a close friendship with. Despite Barnes’ enlistment in the Army and Rogers’ career as Captain America during the war, the two found each other and united to form a solid battlefront against the Axis. When Barnes seemingly fell to his death, Steve Rogers felt as if a brother had been taken from him.</p><br>
        <img src="images\c\c5.jpg"><br>
        <p>Though his time with Peggy Carter was comparatively short to his friendship with Bucky Barnes, Rogers’ feelings toward the capable young woman had begun to blossom into romance before his crash into the Atlantic. The two reunited in the present day, but Carter’s advanced age and her weakening health prevented them from continuing what they’d begun during the war. Regardless, Rogers maintained his connection with the woman until her death from natural causes and looks forward to what the future may bring with his relationship to Sharon Carter, Peggy’s great-niece and S.H.I.E.L.D.’s Agent 13.</p><br>
        <p>Through their partnership in the Avengers and S.H.I.E.L.D., Steve Rogers and Natasha Romanoff have formed a friendship, something the infamous Black Widow does not offer lightly. Despite moments of Rogers’ distrust of Romanoff’s decisions and her prodding of him to fully embrace the modern world, an underlying understanding exists between the two heroes.</p><br>
        <img src="images\c\c6.jpg"><br>
        <p>Captain America has also formed a bond with Sam Wilson, known as the Falcon, who has shown intense loyalty to Rogers. His relationship with Iron Man Tony Stark remains a difficult one to categorize, given the rift the two have had.</p><br>
        <img src="images\c\c7.jpg"><br>
        <p>Captain America took the fight directly to the Red Skull when he led an invasion of the villain’s base in an all-out attempt to break Hydra’s hold on the war. Rogers successfully boarded the Skull’s aircraft as it took off to launch an attack on the United States. But, when his foe’s powerful Tesseract energy source spelled the Red Skull’s doom, the Super-Soldier found himself with no other alternative then to purposefully crash the plane to stop its pre-programmed drive toward America. While Peggy Carter listened through radio communications with the aircraft, Steve Rogers took it down into the icy North Atlantic waters and apparently to his death.</p><br>
        <img src="images\c\c8.jpg"><br>
        <p>Instead, Captain America entered into a state of suspended animation after the crash, and was recovered in the present day by S.H.I.E.L.D., the successor to Peggy Carter’s Strategic Scientific Reserve. Awakened, he learned of his current status and began the long journey to acclimating to a brand-new, modern world.</p><br>
        <p>Almost immediately upon Steve Roger’s revival in the present, he was offered a spot in Nick Fury’s Avengers Initiative and took his place among other heroes, including Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and the Hulk. The group first came together to battle Thor’s brother Loki. However, their initial teamwork was marred by internal strife, chiefly between Rogers and Tony Stark AKA Iron Man, the son of Rogers’ old wartime companion, Howard. The team eventually finally truly came together in the wake of their colleague Phil Coulson’s death at the hands of Loki.</p><br>
        <img src="images\c\c9.jpg"><br>
        <p>In the ensuing battle in New York between the Avengers and Loki and his alien forces, Captain America took charge as a natural leader, coming up with an on-the-spot plan to contain the fight as much as possible to help innocent civilians escape. Loki was defeated. While the Avengers parted ways for the time being, the group had developed mutual respect for one another, as well as the desire to maintain the team when they were needed to address larger threats.</p><br>
        <p>After filming a series of Public Service Announcements on different subjects for high school students, Captain America continued to acclimate to modern times and forged friendships with fellow Avenger Natasha Romanoff AKA Black Widow and a USAF operative named Sam Wilson. Rogers was spending much of his time assisting S.H.I.E.L.D. in the field.</p><br>
        <p>Both Romanoff and Wilson aided him when it was discovered that Hydra had long ago infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. and Rogers was on the run after an attempt to silence him. Rogers found another ally in Sharon Carter, an undercover S.H.I.E.L.D. agent he would later learn was Peggy Carter’s great niece. At this time, Rogers also discovered his old friend Bucky Barnes had not in fact died during World War II, but became a brainwashed sleeper agent and assassin for Hydra called the Winter Soldier. In the midst of stopping Hydra’s nefarious “Project Insight” program, Cap and Bucky battled, and Cap’s pleas to his old friend to remember who he was finally seemed to succeed, as Bucky saved Rogers from drowning, though he vanished in the aftermath.</p><br>
        <img src="images\c\c10.jpg"><br>
        <p>Re-teaming with the Avengers to take out remaining Hydra cells brought Roger’s into contact with the enhanced siblings Wanda and Pietro Maximoff, as the Avengers retrieved the powerful staff Loki had used in his attempt to conquer Earth. After Tony Stark and Bruce Banner used the staff to help create a free-thinking robot called Ultron, only for Ultron to turn on humanity, Rogers took Stark to task over the situation, setting off a deep-seated disagreement between the two men. The Avengers, now joined by a regretful Wanda and Pietro, faced off with Ultron in the small nation of Sokovia, and although they defeated the robot, they failed to prevent the loss of Pietro or the devastation of the Sokovian people and their community.</p><br>
        <img src="images\c\c11.jpg"><br>
        <p>Leading a new lineup of the Avengers, Captain America continued his work to fight criminals around the globe. But, when several innocents died during a confrontation with Cap’s enemy, Brock Rumlow, it set off a chain reaction that resulted in a United Nations-backed program called the Sokovia Accords, which would be used to register and control the actions of super humans and costumed champions. Steve Rogers and Tony Stark grappled with opposite opinions on the matter, with Rogers firmly against the concept of the Accords, which in turn led to the Avengers and various other heroes taking sides in the growing conflict. In the midst of this, Steve also had to deal with the death of the now-elderly Peggy Carter and was reunited with Sharon, who once again covertly helped him, while the two took tentative steps towards a romance.</p><br>
        <p>During these events, Bucky also resurfaced after a lethal bomb was set off during a United Nation gathering over the Accords and the Winter Soldier was framed for the horrific act. The victims of that bombing included Wakanda's king, T’Chaka, leading his son, Prince T’Challa, the Black Panther, to seek revenge against Barnes. Inevitably, the tensions between Cap and his friends and their former teammates turned physical, with T’Challa among those fighting with Stark, as Rogers strove to protect Barnes and find the real culprit.</p><br>
        <img src="images\c\c12.jpg"><br>
        <p>A truce was briefly called when Rogers and Stark both discovered the bombing was actually caused by Helmut Zemo, a Sokovian who lost his family during the Avengers battle against Ultron. However, the situation escalated again when Stark, as part of Zemo’s insidious plan to destroy the Avengers, learned that it was Barnes who had killed his parents years before and that Rogers had kept the information from him. In a bitter fight between Iron Man and Captain America, Rogers managed to eventually subdue Stark and walked away from the Avengers completely, leaving his shield behind. However, he sent Tony a message soon after, explaining his regrets over what had happened and letting Tony know he would be there for him should the need arise, leaving Stark a phone he could use to contact him if need be.</p><br>
        <p>After breaking out the heroes who’d fought alongside him against Stark’s crew—and been imprisoned as a result—Steve Rogers accompanied Bucky Barnes to the technologically advanced nation of Wakanda to seek the aid of T’Challa, who also had learned of Barnes’ innocence in his father’s death. The Black Panther agreed to help his former foes, assuring Captain America it would be far from easy for any who may learn of Barnes’ presence in Wakanda and attempt to strike at him there.</p><br>
        <p>For the next two years, Rogers remained on the run, staying in close contact with fellow fugitives Romanoff, Wilson, and Maximoff. Rogers eventually came out of hiding when Bruce Banner used the phone he’d left Stark to make contact, informing Rogers of the impending threat of Thanos, who was hunting for Vision’s mind stone. In Scotland, Rogers, Romanoff, and Wilson arrived in time to help fend off an attack against Maximoff and Vision by Thanos’ agents</p><br>
        <img src="images\c\c13.jpg"><br>
        <p>Briefly returning to Avengers headquarters in upstate New York, Rogers refused to accept Vision’s offer to have the mind stone destroyed knowing it would lead to Vision’s death. When it was suggested by Banner that there may be a way to remove the stone but keep Vision alive, Rogers once more sought help from T’Challa and the advanced science of Wakanda.</p><br>
        <img src="images\c\c14.jpg"><br>
        <p>In Wakanda, Rogers and several fellow Avengers and allies, including Bucky, joined forces with T’Challa and his people to fight an army of Thanos’ followers, hoping to hold them off long enough for the stone to successfully be removed and destroyed. Despite their valiant effort, Thanos was able to gain possession of the mind stone, ripping it from Vision’s head and leaving him lifeless. Using his Infinity Gauntlet, now powered by all six infinity stones, Thanos snapped his fingers and extinguished half the life in the universe in one fell swoop. Rogers helplessly watched as many around him, including Bucky and other close friends, disintegrated before his eyes.</p><br>

        <h1>
            CAPTAIN AMERICA
        </h1>
        <p>From the dark days of world war to the explosive challenges of today, Super-Soldier Captain America stands ready as a shining sentinel of liberty to shield the oppressed and fight for freedom everywhere.</p><br>
        <h1>Ninety-Eight-Pound Weakling</h1><br>
        <p>A poor orphan from the wrong side of the tracks in the days leading up to World War II, goodhearted Steve Rogers enlisted in the army to fight the Axis Powers, but met with rejection due to his small size and underdeveloped physique. Professor Abraham Erskine, a pioneer in the development of a Super-Soldier for the United States, saw potential in Rogers and whisked him into Project Rebirth, the professor’s bold experiment in enhancing the human body to its peak powers.</p><br>
        <p>Rogers found himself subjected to Erskine’s treatments— a specialized serum and exposure to a unique form of radiation—and realized the professor’s dream, becoming the world’s first, fully developed Super-Soldier. Now muscular and tall, as well as possessed of amazing strength and agility, the former ninety-eight-pound weakling watched in horror as a Nazi spy shot and killed Erskine, and thereby ensured Rogers would be the last of his kind.</p><br>
        <p>The United States government moved swiftly to fashion Rogers into a living symbol of inspiration to the public at home and soldiers abroad. And, after extensive combat training he debuted in a colorful, patriotic uniform as Captain America. Operating out of the army’s Camp Lehigh in Virginia, Rogers posed as an ordinary soldier, but conducted secret missions stateside and abroad as his alter-ego to smash spies, saboteurs, and the occasional Super Villain who threatened the country he loved so dearly. Soon, Cap captured the attention of the Red Skull, his evil counterpart in Germany, and the two formed a lasting enmity over the course of the war. The hero also gained a near-indestructible shield with which he became supremely efficient in both offense and defense.</p><br>
        <img src="images\c\cc1.jpg"><br>
        <p>More costumed champions began to appear and founded a fighting battalion known as the Invaders with Captain America. The Super-Soldier also struck up a close friendship with a young man named Bucky Barnes who was perceived as a kind of sidekick on Cap’s missions, though Bucky possessed his own formidable skills. Toward the end of the war, the famous fighting duo closed in on Baron Zemo, a Nazi scientist who’d committed nearly as many atrocities against the Allies as the Red Skull, and moved to destroy an experimental plane he coveted. Unfortunately, Cap and Bucky found themselves caught in the aircraft’s fiery demise while in flight, and both tumbled into the ocean, leading Cap to believe Bucky had perished in the explosion.</p><br>
        <p>Due to Erskine’s serum coursing through his veins, Cap’s body went into suspended animation once submerged in the frigid waters, and ended up encased in solid ice. In this manner, he slept away the decades until discovered by the Avengers, a team of Super Heroes, in modern times. Awakened and resuscitated, Cap’s astonishment in realizing he’d lost Bucky and everyone he’d ever cared for quickly gave way to his unshakable sense of duty and he once again donned his famous shield and outfit to join with the Avengers in their ongoing battle against injustice.</p><br>
        <h1>Patriotic Power</h1><br>
        <p>After being infused with the Super-Soldier serum, Steve Roger’s body reached the upper-most limits of human perfection in strength, stamina, agility, and durability. With training, he learned to use these traits in perfect unison in any given situation. Because of this, many see him as super human, but in truth he maintains a strict regimen of exercise to bolster the serum’s transformation of his physical form. In addition, Rogers’ charisma and shrewd decision-making ability are also recognized as being at the top-level of any human on Earth.</p><br>
        <img src="images\c\cc2.jpg"><br>
        <p>As Captain America, he carries a concave shield composed of vibranium and steel alloy. This makes the disc lightweight, nearly indestructible, and perfectly balanced. Cap’s extensive use of the shield in combat situations has formed a kind of symbiosis between the two, making the disc practically an extension of his will. Hurtling it with his enhanced strength and marksmanship, he can strike several opponents in quick succession and catch it on its return arc. The shield can also withstand extreme temperatures and pressure, as well as rebound most forms of energy directed at it.</p><br>
        <p>Cap’s unique uniform is made of a tight-woven chainmail, able to deflect sharp objects and some smaller gauges of projectiles. He has also been seen wearing a belt equipped with pouches for quick access to a variety of useful items.</p><br>
        <h1>Circle of Friends</h1><br>
        <p>Many of Captain America’s friends and allies during World War II were lost to him due to the ravages of time during his suspended animation, and in the present day his closest companions are few in number.
        </p><br>
        <p>James Buchanan “Bucky” Barnes survived the explosion of Baron Zemo’s plane to be snatched up by Russian operatives and brainwashed into an instrument of death, the Winter Soldier. Bucky eventually broke the deep conditioning to reaffirm a friendship with Steve Rogers that stretched back to the earliest days of the war, and today the two men think of themselves as brothers.</p><br>
        <p>When Cap met Sharon Carter, S.H.I.E.L.D.’s invaluable Agent 13, and learned she was the niece of his wartime flame Peggy Carter, the die was cast for them to become soulmates. Through thick and thin they’ve maintained their bond, even through tumultuous times like when Steve Roger’s temporary death came at the hands of a manipulated Sharon. Though the two may sometimes dream of a shared life together, their respective careers keep them from settling down as husband and wife.</p><br>
        <img src="images\c\cc3.jpg"><br>
        <p>Sam Wilson and Steve Rogers met under fire on a far-off island and became fast friends and later crimefighting partners when Cap helped Wilson create his Super Hero persona of the Falcon. Though both grew up on the mean city streets and share a common belief in justice and liberty, the two have more than once disagreed on matters of opinion, but have always reminded themselves of their friendship.</p><br>
        <h1>Axis of Evil</h1><br>
        <p>Captain America toiled tirelessly to earn enemies throughout his career, but none so much as the Red Skull. The skull-faced villain charted his own course after his “creation” by Adolph Hitler himself, but he retained the Nazi mindset of superiority and world-dominance. Crafty and cunning, he waylaid Cap at every turn, even surviving into the modern age to bedevil his adversary time and time again. The Skull recognized Cap as his mortal enemy - perhaps not a genuine equal, but as someone whose image was to be corrupted, his goals subverted, and his life ruined. The Sentinel of Liberty never underestimated the Red Skull, and despite witnessing his supposed death many times, rarely believed his threat had truly ended.</p><br>
        <p>Baron Heinrich Zemo nearly rivaled the Red Skull in his battles with Captain America. Originally a Nazi scientist, Zemo’s diabolical inventions included a super adhesive to which he himself fell prey, leading to his mask becoming permanently adhered to his face. Zemo, like the Skull, survived the war to form the first Masters of Evil in the modern era, a group of Super Villains that opposed the Avengers and other heroes. Though Heinrich ultimately met his end, his twisted son Helmut picked up the Baron Zemo mantle and continued his father’s endless skirmishes with Cap.</p><br>
        <p>Another purveyor of warped science from the World War II era, geneticist Arnim Zola created incredible beings to do his bidding, but battled Captain America many times to prove his mind was the superior. In recent years, Zola became the master of an entire other dimension apart from our own, one in which Cap led a revolt to disrupt the evil scientist’s mad dreams.</p><br>
        <p>One other adversary rose up from the war era to follow Cap into the modern world: Baron Strucker. The evil aristocrat founded the organization which became known as Hydra, a global scheme to dominate the world through terrorism and subversion. Other hands have since replaced Strucker in the leadership of Hydra, but his dark legacy lives on.</p><br>
        <p>Other enemies of Captain America include the Red Skull’s right-hand lieutenant Crossbones, the Skull’s daughter Sin, the bizarre entity known as M.O.D.O.K., wayward psychiatrist Dr. Faustus, the acrobat Batroc, the anarchist Flag Smasher, and the snake-themed Super Villains who make up the dreaded Serpent Society.</p><br>
        <h1>Shield Stories</h1><br>
        <p>Captain America’s adventures in modern times kicked off with several missions with the Avengers that culminated in him taking over the leadership role when the founding members stepped back to address their individual lives and careers. Cap reorganized the team as a small fighting band consisting of outlaws Hawkeye, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch, which the press dubbed “Cap’s Kooky Quartet.” He made it work somehow until the original members came back to once again fill the ranks.</p><br>
        <p>S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury, whom Cap knew during World War II, approached the hero with an offer to join the spy organization, and through several missions for them Cap faced various menaces and met Agent 13, Sharon Carter. The Red Skull returned, having secured a Cosmic Cube, a device granting its user near-unlimited power, but Cap smashed the villain’s plans. Later, after his civilian identity as Steve Rogers was publicly revealed, he worked to train an eager young teenager named Rick Jones as his new partner, all the while mourning Bucky.</p><br>
        <img src="images\c\cc4.jpg"><br>
        <p>The Falcon grew into the role of Cap’s partner when Rick and the hero grew apart, and Cap became a police officer in his civilian life. He returned to the Avengers after a brief hiatus from membership when the team faced the galactic menace of two powerful alien races battling each other in the Kree-Skrull War. Around this time, Cap also addressed the appearance of the man who posed as Captain America while the real deal slept away the decades. Later, Helmut Zemo, the son of the original Baron Zemo, rose up to claim his father’s legacy and continue his evil.
            When the Secret Empire, another subversive group, made a play to take over the United States, Cap disrupted their gambit, but was crestfallen when he discovered the true identity of the Empire’s masked leader to be a high-ranking government official. His faith in his country shaken to the core, he abandoned the role of Captain America to temporarily adventure as Nomad until circumstances drove him to once again take up the shield and the old red, white, and blue. As Cap again, he and the Falcon strengthened their partnership to face the Madbomb crisis as well as the rise of Arnim Zola as a mad geneticist.</p><br>
            <p>Following a string of violent clashes, the Red Skull accelerated Cap’s physical body to match his true age, and the two entered into what the Skull believed would be their final battle. In the end, Cap believed his greatest enemy to be dead. Later, the Serpent Society crawled into the light to challenge the hero, and Cap set up a national “hotline” to answer calls for help across the country. Back in New York, Zemo and the latest edition of the Masters of Evil invaded Avengers Mansion, captured Cap, and destroyed precious mementoes of his before his eyes.</p><br>
            <img src="images\c\cc5.jpg"><br>
            <p>The U.S. government removed Rogers from the Cap role, forcing him to rebrand himself as “The Captain,” so he could continue his crusading career. When he returned to the shield, his replacement, John Walker, became a new government operative called the USAgent. Strange times followed, including a romance with a former Serpent Society member, a transformation into a werewolf, and a breakdown of the Super-Soldier serum in his blood that forced Cap to don armor and eventually led to his disappearance, perhaps to die alone.
                Rogers was revived in time to take up the shield against a resurrected Red Skull and a new threat involving the Cosmic Cube. Once again stripped of his Cap role not long after, he operated as an “ex-patriot” until returning to his old uniform. For a brief time following that, Cap found himself submerged in a new reality apart from his own, wherein he operated as a somewhat different Captain America, until brought back to his proper existence. Soon after, Cap would lose his shield at the bottom of the ocean and be forced to use makeshift replacements. Luckily, the real shield was recovered and returned to its rightful owner.</p><br>
                <p>One of the Avengers’ greatest foes, the time-traveling Kang, invaded Earth with an immense army, but the assembled heroes fought back and Cap himself faced Kang in personal combat and defeated him. The Red Skull later worked secretly as Dell Rusk, the U.S. Secretary of Defense, until exposed by Cap, while the Scarlet Witch, one of the original “Kooky Quartet” members went mad and attempted to obliterate the Avengers. In the days that followed, Bucky resurfaced alive as the Winter Soldier, a brainwashed Russian assassin, and Cap helped a small group of teenage heroes form the Young Avengers out of the ashes of Scarlet Witch’s assault.</p><br>
                <img src="images\c\cc6.jpg"><br> 
                <p>When Cap’s teammate Iron Man proposed and pushed through into law a Superhuman Registration Act, Cap vocally disagreed with it and a period of “Civil War” erupted between the two old friends. Spreading to the entire Super Hero community, the skirmishes escalated until Rogers realized the toll it was taking on the public and surrendered to the authorities. Incarcerated, he fell to an assassination attempt concocted by the Red Skull, which used a duped Sharon Carter as the instrument of death.
                    Steve Rogers’ essence wandered through time, reliving moments throughout his career as Cap, but was brought back to the present to be rejoined with his body, although not without a battle with the Red Skull for possession of it. While believed dead, Cap’s mantle was taken up by Bucky and Rogers insisted his old partner maintain the role while he himself became the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. for a time. As always, he returned as Captain America when the world and the heroic community needed him most, during a siege on the fabled realm of Asgard. Unfortunately, Cap’s shield was later broken in the midst of another crisis involving godlike beings, but was repaired, albeit with a scar to remind its user of the high price of being a champion.</p><br>
                     <p>Cap organized an Avengers Unity Squad to bring together humans and mutants for the greater good and one of their first challenges involved a Red Skull clone who stole the brain of the late Professor X, a powerful mutant with psychic abilities. Once again, the Super-Soldier serum was neutralized in Cap’s blood, causing him to outwardly transform into nearly his true advanced physical age. The Falcon became Captain America during this time, until a sentient Cosmic Cube known as Kobik restored Rogers to his heroic stature, but also to a warped mindset manipulated by the Red Skull in which Cap was raised as an agent of Hydra, bent on subjugating the world to the group’s twisted domination ideals.</p><br>
                     <img src="images\c\cc7.jpg"><br>
                     <p>The true Steve Rogers resurfaced when given a body by Kobik and the Hydra version was defeated, and Captain America headed out to travel the United States in search of not only himself, but the real America he loves so much.</p><br>
