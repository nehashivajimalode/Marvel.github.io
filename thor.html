        <h1>THOR ODINSON</h1>
        <p>THOR</p>
        <p>The son of Odin uses his mighty abilities as the God of Thunder to protect his home Asgard and planet Earth alike.</p>
        <p>Thor Odinson wields the power of the ancient Asgardians to fight evil throughout the Nine Realms and beyond.</p><br>

    <hr><h1 style="background-color: gray;">BIOGRAPHY</h1><hr>
    <div style="margin-left: 400px;">
        <h1>If I had a Hammer</h1><br>
        <p>Born 1500 years ago to Odin and Frigga, the king and queen of fabled Asgard, Thor grew into a mighty warrior and protector of his home and people. Thought to be rash and even reckless by his father, Thor nevertheless looked forward to the day of his ascension to the throne. But, his adoptive brother Loki schemed in private to ensure that day never arrived. He manipulated Thor into attacking the Frost Giants, legendary adversaries of the Asgardians and Loki’s people, and Odin—hoping to teach his son humility—divested Thor of his magic hammer Mjolnir and banished him to Midgard, the realm also known as Earth.</p><br>
        <p>Alone and unable to return to Asgard, Thor met scientists Jane Foster and Erik Selvig in the midst of their investigation into strange activity near a small New Mexico town. While his brother struggled with the limitations of mortals on Earth, Loki worked to ensure his own seizure of the Asgardian throne and planned to allow the Frost Giant king—his real father—into Asgard to slay Odin in his sleep. Back on Earth, Thor sacrificed himself to save the town from destruction and in doing so, impressed Odin enough to restore him to full Asgardian power.</p><br>
        <img src="images\t\t1.jpg"><br>
        <p>With Mjolnir once again in his grasp and the admiration and possible love of Jane Foster, Thor returned to his home, routed the Frost Giants, and defeated Loki in battle. Chagrined at his loss and stinging from Odin’s condemnation, Loki chose to fall away from Asgard into a strange warp in space while Thor and their father looked on. Though happy to be back in Asgard, Thor’s thoughts were filled with adventure on Midgard with Jane Foster.</p><br>
        <h1>The Trappings of a God</h1><br>
        <p>Like all Asgardians, Thor possesses great strength, endurance, stamina, and long life, but it is his command over the stormy forces of nature that separate him from his brethren as a true son of Odin the Allfather. Thor can call down lightning and thunder at will and utilize them like a blacksmith uses his tools to work iron and steel—bending and shaping them into weapons. Once he believed it was his hammer Mjolnir that granted him these powers, but in truth the ability has rested within him the whole time.</p><br>
        <img src="images\t\t2.jpg"><br>
        <p>For nearly a thousand years Thor holds Mjolnir’s grip in battle, a true companion if ever there was one. The incredible hammer was forged by Odin from the heart of a dying star and gifted to his son for his exclusive use. Odin even places an enchantment on it when he banishes Thor to Midgard, one that would only allow a “worthy” person to lift it and possess the power of the god of thunder. While Thor is with the Avengers on Earth, his comrades all try to handle the hammer, but only Captain America could move it slightly, a feat that its owner takes notice of.</p><br>
        <p>After Mjolnir’s destruction by Hela, Thor forges a new weapon when the threat of Thanos arises. With the help of Eitri, a Dwarven smithy of Nidavellir, and an adolescent Groot, Thor crafts Stormbreaker, an immense axe with some of the same properties as his hammer, along with the ability to open the Bifrost.</p><br>
        <h1>The Dark Half</h1><br>
        <p>Thor develops a number of adversaries in his quest to protect Asgard, and also Midgard, from harm.</p><br>
        <p>The relationship between Thor and Loki may rightfully be categorized as “complicated.” Raised as brothers, the two men know each other better than anyone, yet have been continually at odds, sometimes to notably extreme degrees. Loki’s scheming nature and unbridled egoism comes between him and Thor many times over, causing trouble that has literally impacted entire worlds. Still Thor, overcoming multiple betrayals, believes the man he calls brother can change and embrace the light. And it seems Thor’s belief in his is redeemed when Loki gives his life to protect Thor from Thanos—leaving Thor to deeply mourn his brother’s loss.</p><br>
        <p>Among Thor’s more clear-cut enemies stand Frost Giant King Laufey, Surtur the Fire Giant, the dark elf Malekith, and Thor’s own half-sister Hela, the so-called goddess of death, all of whom have ill intent towards Asgard. Thor also finds himself imprisoned for a time on Sakaar by the Grandmaster.</p><br>
        <p>Thanos earns Thor’s immense hatred after the tyrant’s crusade wipes out many Asgardians and kills loved ones of the god of thunder, making things very personal for him.</p><br>
        <h1>Warriors All</h1><br>
        <p>Thor grows up surrounded by warriors and fighters, and it is among that august group that he can count the majority of his close companions.</p><br>
        <p>Heimdall, all-seeing keeper of the Bifrost Bridge, offers Thor advice and counsel whenever he requests it, and many times when he does not. Thor treasures his friendship with Heimdall, and they often fight back to back against those who threaten their home. Likewise, both Sif and the Warriors Three (Volstagg, Fandral, and Hogun) are valued comrades of Thor, battling at his side over the years. They take pride in the fact that they always had each other’s backs in a fight, until the Warriors Three perish during Hela’s siege on Asgard.</p><br>
        <img src="images\t\t3.jpg"><br>
        <p>On Earth, Jane Foster is a warrior in her own right, a woman who stands up for what she believes in and never backs down no matter how big a challenge she faces. These traits impress Thor from the moment he meets the young scientist, and their admiration for each other quickly grows into love. Whenever Thor is away from Earth, he counts the minutes until he returns to Jane Foster’s side. Unfortunately, the two part ways eventually. The Asgardian also feels a bond with Dr. Erik Selvig, Foster’s partner, and he looks to the scientist many times for insight not only into deep matters, but also for his knowledge of the world.</p><br>
        <p>Of all of Thor’s Avengers teammates, Steve Rogers, Captain America, is perhaps the one that he trusts most with his life, though he will always remain a faithful companion to the others, including Tony Stark and Bruce Banner. The latter, in fact, more recently becomes a closer friend to Thor, as Banner’s alter ego the Hulk battles Thor in the gladiatorial arena on Sakaar and fights beside him in Asgard.</p><br>
        <p>Thor also makes the acquaintance of one of the fabled Valkyrie on Sakaar, a warrior woman self-exiled from Asgard and her duties as one of its protectors. Though she at first opposes everything Thor stands for, she comes around to his desire to return to Asgard and vanquish its conqueror, Hela. In doing so, she becomes yet another staunch ally of the thunder god’s, as does the Kronan named Korg, who also fights with Thor on both Sakaar and Asgard.</p><br>
        <img src="images\t\t4.jpg"><br>
        <p>While Thor encounters all of the Guardians of the Galaxy, he forges a special bond with Rocket, who accompanies him on his journey to create Stormbreaker in order to battle Thanos. Groot, who also joined that mission, becomes an ally as well.</p><br>
        <h1>For Asgard and the Avengers</h1><br>
        <p>When Loki made his way to Earth to capture the fabled Tesseract—one of the infamous Infinity Stones—for his own plans and schemes, Thor asked Odin to use dark magic to send him to the planet also, so that he could confront his brother. While there, Thor came across a small group of loose-knit Earth heroes attempting to stop Loki, so he took command of his brother himself. In doing so, he brought about a battle with Iron Man and Captain America. When the dust cleared and Loki had escaped, Thor agreed to work alongside the Avengers to bring his brother to justice.</p><br>
        <p>Finally seizing Loki, the Avengers brought him into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, but unfortunately also into close proximity to Bruce Banner, whose alter-ego the Hulk turned out to be one of Loki’s true targets. Thor was forced to battle an enraged Hulk until the Avengers could sort out the situation and come together as a real team to defeat Thor’s wayward brother. Thor joined alongside the Avengers in New York and ultimately defeated Loki and the Chitauri army he led. With Loki bound as his prisoner, Thor bid farewell to his new Midgard companions and returned home with the Tesseract.</p><br>
        <img src="images\t\t5.jpg"><br>
        <p>Back in Asgard, Odin charged his son with traveling through the Nine Realms and addressing hot spots of vandals, marauders, and other troublemakers. Unbeknownst to him at the time, Jane Foster came in contact with the Aether, another of the Infinity Stones, and unwittingly bonded with it. Discovering the event, Thor brought Foster to Asgard for examination and safekeeping, but when the Dark Elves invaded Asgard to take back the Aether, Thor’s mother Frigga died while valiantly defending her husband and her home.</p><br>
        <p>After a series of clashes with Malekith, the Dark Elves’ ruler, both on the Elves’ home world of Svartalfheim and Earth, Thor managed to defeat his foe in the midst of a mixture of assistance, interference and subterfuge from Loki —who then feigned his own death—and wrested the Aether from him. Later, he approached Odin to tell his father he had no real desire to rule Asgard, not knowing that his brother had secretly replaced their father and was posing as him.</p><br>
        <p>Returning to Earth sometime later, Thor rejoined the Avengers to hunt the global terrorist organization called Hydra in various spots around the globe. In the small nation of Sokovia, he and his partners recovered Loki’s powerful scepter from a Hydra base, but Tony Stark later used it to create an artificial intelligence dubbed Ultron, much to Thor’s chagrin. While they began to deal with the malicious robot, Thor came under the spell of the Scarlet Witch, a young Sokovian with incredible mind-warping powers, and received a hellish vision.</p><br>
        <img src="images\t\t6.jpg"><br>
        <p>With his friend Dr. Erik Selvig, Thor traveled to the magical Water of Sight to look further into the troubling vision and learn more about the Infinity Stones. Back with his teammates, he brought lightning down to aid in the creation of another artificial being—this one a true ally, whom the Avengers dubbed the Vision. Together, they battled and defeated Ultron, but watched helplessly as the entire Sokovian capital was destroyed in the process.</p><br>
        <p>Thor felt his next labor should be a comprehensive search throughout the Nine Realms to gather up the Infinity Stones. While on this quest he encountered and was captured by the Fire Giant Surtur, the being who was fabled to bring about Ragnarok, the ultimate destruction of Asgard. Thor defeated Surtur, and believing he’d stopped the advance of Ragnarok, flew back to his home to relay the news to his father. There, he found only Loki disguised as Odin. Angered, he broke the illusion and took his brother with him to Earth to begin tracking Odin’s whereabouts.</p><br>
        <img src="images\t\t7.jpg"><br>
        <p>With help from the sorcerer Doctor Strange, the two brothers found their father living simply in Norway, but also near death. Upon his peaceful demise, his first child Hela, mistress of death, was able to leave the prison Odin placed her in millennia before and return to conquer the Asgardians. Thor opposed her instantly, but Hela shattered Mjolnir and left to invade Asgard.</p><br>
        <p>Falling through space after his encounter with Hela, Thor crashed down upon the planet of Sakaar, where the infamous being called the Grandmaster ran a gladiatorial arena. Seemingly without his unique powers from his hammer, Thor became a fighter and found himself face to face with the champion of the realm, his old Avengers comrade the Hulk. Together with the green giant and Valkyrie, one of the fabled female warrior-protectors of Asgard, they flew off to Thor’s home to confront Hela with some help from Loki and the freed Sakaarian gladiators, too.</p><br>
        <img src="images\t\t8.jpg"><br>
        <p>During the ensuing battle, Thor lost an eye to Hela’s immense powers, but also learned that his command over thunder and lightning rested within him, not in lost Mjolnir. With resumed confidence in himself, he saw to Surtur’s rebirth and the advent of Ragnarok in order to destroy Hela’s threat once and for all. Though this meant the loss of Asgard as well, as Thor realized it was important to save the citizens of his land more than the land itself. Finally embracing his role as king of his people, Thor led the Asgardian survivors and the allies who fought with him onto a starship, intending to hear to Earth.</p><br>
        <p>At some point in the ship’s travels, Thanos interrupted its voyage to decimate the Asgardians onboard and take the Tesseract from Loki. Thor witnessed the murder of both Heimdall and Loki and swore to kill Thanos, a proclamation the tyrant shrugged off as he destroyed the ship and teleported away. Later, the Guardians of the Galaxy found Thor floating in space and upon rescuing him, the thunder god declared his intention to forge a Thanos-killing weapon on Nidavellir, the same place Mjolnir was crafted.</p><br>
        <p>Thor left on his journey accompanied by Groot and Rocket, and during their travels, Rocket gave him a cybernetic eye to replace the one Hela had cut out. The trio arrived at Nidavellir to find it cold and inoperable, but with the aid of the Dwarf smithy Eitri, Thor restarted the forge and created Stormbreaker, a gigantic axe.</p><br>
        <img src="images\t\t9.jpg"><br>
        <p>Using Stormbreaker’s ability to command the Bifrost to return to Earth, he arrived in Wakanda to join the fight against Thanos’ forces, who were attempting to wrest an Infinity Stone from the android Vision’s head. Thor destroyed many of the alien troops, turning the tide of the battle, and was reunited with Captain America and other Avengers during the fight.</p><br>
        <p>However, when Thanos himself arrived, he successfully got ahold of the Mind Stone and added it to his Infinity Gauntlet. Determined to kill his enemy, Thor buried Stormbreaker in the tyrant’s chest. Unfortunately, Thanos was still able to snap his fingers, and with the combined might of all six Infinity Stones, wipe away exactly half of all life in the universe. Thanos teleported away, and Thor and those who were spared watched many treasured allies disintegrate before them.</p><br>

    <div style="margin-left: 400px;">
        <h1>
            THOR
        </h1>
        <p>Thor, the God of Thunder, the son of Odin, the Asgardian prince, wields the mystical mallet Mjolnir as he protects innocents across the realms on his own and as a member of the Avengers. He takes his name from the inscription on his famous weapon.</p><br>
        <p>The very skies tremble in his presence. He commands the mystical hammer Mjolnir to protect Asgard and Earth. He is the son of Odin, Prince of Asgard. He is the God of Thunder. He is Thor.</p><br>
        <h1>The God of Thunder</h1><br>
        <p>Thor was born to the King of the Asgardian Gods, Odin Borson, and the Earth Goddess Gaea. He grew up in Asgard under Odin's tutelage and trained in his footsteps to one day lead Asgard. Besides Odin, his stepmother Frigga and his adopted brother Loki are the only family he know, alongside his best friends Sif, Balder, and the Warriors Three.</p><br>
        <p>Throughout his youth, Thor tested his limits on dangerous missions and became worthy of the Uru hammer Mjolnir, using it to save Sif from the Death Goddess Hela. While the hammer wields destructive powers, it also has the power to build and Thor also uses it to consecrate treaties and bless weddings.</p><br>
        <p>In Thor's coming of age, he fell through a portal and battled the demigod Hercules. Equal in strength, they fought until Zeus halted their encounter, sending Thor back to Asgard and wiping the memories of both warriors. During the 9th Century, Thor spent time on Earth, leading Vikings into battle. It was not until Thor's loyal Vikings attacked a Christian monastery that he turned his back on his followers, leaving Earth and spending centuries in Asgard.</p><br>
        <p>During his time in Asgard, Odin casted Thor into the mortal guise of Siegmund to retrieve the Rhinegold Ring from the dragon Fafnir. When Siegmund took away another's wife, Frigga compelled Odin to kill Thor, but Thor survived as Siegmund's son Siegfried. Odin succeeded at obtaining the Rhinegold Ring from Siegfried, then restored Thor to life without any memories of his former identities.</p><br>
        <img src="images\t\tc1.jpg"><br>
        <p>When Thor's battle-hungry appetite led him to break a treaty between Asgard and the Frost Giants, Odin banished him to Earth as a lesson in humility in the form of Dr. Donald Blake. As a human, he had a limp and worked as a physician. When he was compelled by Odin to go to Norway, he came upon extraterrestrials known as the Kronans and fled into a cave. There, he found a gnarled cane and used it to try and escape; he struck it against a rock, and it became Mjolnir. The mallet then restored his memories and returned him to his former glory as the mighty God of Thunder.</p><br>
        <h1>Worthy Warrior and Weaponry</h1><br>
        <p>Thor, son of Gods, has enhanced longevity, augmented by the Golden Apples of Idunn. He also possesses superhuman strength, speed, agility, durability and immunity to most diseases.</p><br>
        <p>Thor's greatest weapon, and closest ally, is Mjolnir, an enchanted hammer forged from Uru metal, which has power over storms and can generate energy blasts known as anti-force. Thor uses this hammer to summon rain, wind, lightning, and thunder, though he has also been known to produce lightning from his hands. While Mjolnir can manipulate weather patterns, it extends godhood and many other abilities to its commander. When spun, the mallet can allow Thor to fly, hover, and even open portals to other dimensions and realms. When thrown, it acts as a sort of boomerang, destroying all things or beings in its path before returning to its owner.</p><br>
        <p>When Thor became unworthy of holding Mjolnir, he used Jarnbjorn, a deadly war ax.</p><br>
        <h1>Enemies of the God</h1><br>
        <p>Those Who Sit Above in Shadow are a consortium of wicked Gods that feed off the energies resulting from Asgard's repeated destruction, which is known as Ragnarok or "The Twilight of the Gods." The consortium recreates Asgard after each Ragnarok, resulting in an endless loop of creation, destruction, and rebirth.</p><br>
        <p>Hela, the Goddess of Death, is Thor's niece, best known for stealing mortal souls. Once time Thor faces her, she scars him across his face. She also punishes him for releasing her souls and curses him so that he could not heal his injuries, but also not die.</p><br>
        <img src="images\t\tc2.jpg"><br>
        <p>Loki, an Asgardian menace, forever seeks to sow chaos out of his jealousy towards his adopted brother Thor. Whether he is trying to steal the Golden Apples of Idunn or posing as Odin, he's rarely an ally.</p><br>
        <p>The Celestials are the omnipotent judges of all the Gods, are limitless in their power, and often serve as foils to the Asgardian royalty.</p><br>
        <p>Karnilla, the Norn Queen and ancestral Asgardian enemy, possesses powerful mystic talismans called Norn Stones. These stones are semi-sentient and are known to refuse the commands of unworthy holders, just as Mjolnir does so. She has used these many times in her battles with the God of Thunder.</p><br>
        <p>The Ennead Egyptian/Heliopolitan Death God Seth wages war on the Asgardians and captures Odin, imprisoning him in his Black Pyramid. Once Thor rescues Odin, and Odin bests Seth in Asgard.</p><br>
        <p>Surtur, a fire demon, attacks Asgard so that he might claim the eternal flame and complete the forging of his sword Twilight. He proves to be a menace time and time again for Asgard and Earth, eternally stuck in a battle with Odin. The Sons of Muspel also serve Surtur against the realm.</p><br>
        <p>Absorbing Man, Amora the Enchantress, Skurge the Executioner, Ego the Living Planet, Demon Lord Mephisto, Mangog, and Malekith the Accursed, the Dark Elf from Svartalfheim are also known foes to Thor.</p><br>
        <h1>Allies, Friends, Family</h1><br>
        <p>Thor's allies include Odin Borson, his father and King of the Asgardians; his mother and Earth Goddess Gaea; and his stepmother Frigga. His best friends include Sif (whom he has intermittent romances with), Balder, and the Warriors Three: Fandral the Dashing, Hogun the Grim, and Volstagg the Enormous.</p><br>
        <p>The God Heimdall is the guardian of Asgard. He protects the Asgardian borders and the Bifrost, and is forever an ally to Thor.</p><br>
        <p>On Earth, Thor bands together with Iron Man, the Hulk, Ant-Man, and the Wasp to found the Avengers. Later, when the Hulk leaves, Steve Rogers, AKA Captain America, joins the fold and becomes close friends with the God.</p><br>
        <img src="images\t\tc3.jpg"><br>
        <p>Beta Ray Bill, a warrior alien, bests Thor in battle one time. As a reward for his strength, Odin creates a new hammer known as Stormbreaker for Bill. Bill subsequently fights alongside Thor, the Avengers, and Fantastic Four during an engagement on Earth in battle with Surtur.</p><br>
        <p>Eric Masterson, an acquaintance of one of Thor's secret identities, Sigurd Jarlson, becomes bonded to Thor and acts a guise for him. He, occasionally, gains control of their shared body, and even takes on the codename Thunderstrike.</p><br>
        <p>Jane Foster, a human nurse that Donald Blake falls in love with, often finds herself wrapped up in Thor's orbit, whether romantically or as an ally. She also proves to be worthy of Mjolnir and even takes on the mantle of Thor.</p><br>
        <h1>Rolling Thunder</h1><br>
        <p>Thor has traveled across the realms, battling all enemies of Asgard and Earth, including the Death Goddess Hela and Olympian demigod Hercules. Though both Thor and Hercules fought on opposite sides during the Norwegian and Greek war in the year 1,000, they eventually teamed up and remain friendly rivals. It was his time on Earth leading the Vikings that began the Norwegian myth of the God of Thunder.</p><br>
        <p>In one iteration of Asgard, Thor's thirst for battle led him to break an Asgardian treaty with the Frost Giants, leading Odin to punish him; Odin sent him to Earth as Dr. Donald Blake. When Blake discovered that he is the Norse God of Thunder known as Thor and is reunited with Mjolnir, he chose to divide his time between his life as an ordinary human doctor and an immortal God.</p><br>
        <p>As Blake, he fell in love with the human Jane Foster. When he requested permission from Odin to marry her, Odin refused and told Thor he wasn't allowed to share his true identity with her. His affinity for Earth has caused many arguments and rifts between him and his father.</p><br>
        <p>When Loki took advantage of his brother's love of Earth, Thor sought the help of Iron Man, the Hulk, Ant-Man, and the Wasp to ward off the Asgardian menace. His trickery led Thor and these super powered individuals to found the Super Hero group called the Avengers.</p><br>
        <p>Balancing his dual lives, Thor continued to pursue Foster. Foster was granted temporary Goddess status, but Odin required proof of her worth. He set impossible tasks for her on Asgard, but she was unable to cope and returned to Earth, eventually marrying a man named Keith Kincaid. After this disappointing decision, Thor reunited with his friend Sif to share a romance.</p><br>
        <p>Thor continued as Asgard's greatest defender, fighting off terrible foes such as the evil Mangog who disguised himself as Odin. During his reign, he bested Thor along with his allies the Warriors Three, but Thor ultimately defeated Mangog.</p><br>
        <p>When Ragnarok threatened Asgard's demise, Roger "Red" Norvell took up Thor's mantle using his Belt of Strength and unique gauntlets to battle the Midguard Serpent. He died in doing so, but helped the realm narrowly avoid Ragnarok.</p><br>
        <p>Enemies and wars aside, family drama reigned supreme as the God learned late in life who his real birth mother was. While he was born in Asgard to Odin and raised by his stepmother Frigga, the Earth Goddess Gaea actually bore him.</p><br>
        <p>Thor, in his continued travels, encountered the alien Beta Ray Bill. Bill thought Thor to be a demon and seized Thor's hammer, proving himself worthy to wield it. Because they were so evenly matched, Odin created Stormbreaker, a new hammer to be used by Bill. Thor joined forces with Bill to help battle Sons of Muspel, demons serving the fire demon Surtur that threatened Bill's people.</p><br>
        <p>It was just after this encounter that S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury helped Thor establish a new identity and helped encourage him to keep in touch with humanity as Sigurd Jarlson, a construction worker.</p><br>

        <img src="images\t\tc5.jpg"><br>
        <p>To break the Ragnarok cycle and foil Those Who Sit Above in Shadow, Thor let Asgard fall, allowing himself to presumably die. His demise proved false, though, when it was revealed that he was actually sent to a limbo-like dimension.</p><br>
        <p>During the Super Hero Civil War, Tony Stark was desperate for Thor's assistance and cloned Thor from one of his hairs to create a cybernetic version of him known as Ragnarok. The clone lacked moral sense, though, and became an enemy of the Avengers.</p><br>
        <p>When Thor arrived to limbo, it expelled his Donald Blake aspect back to Earth. Mjolnir also returned to Earth, so Blake retrieved it and then convinced Thor to come back from limbo to reestablish Asgard; Thor did so by moving it from a different to its new home hovering over Broxton, Oklahoma. There, Thor discovered Iron Man's Thor clone and the implementation of the Superhuman Registration Act. He then departed from the Avengers and devoted himself to restoring the slain Asgardians from Ragnarok.</p><br>
        <p>During this restoration process, Loki schemed and mimicked Sif, who was trapped in the dying Rose Chamber's body. Loki drew out Balder, a prospective ruler and son to Odin, and revived Bor, Odin's father. Unaware of who Bor was, Thor slayed him, breaking Mjolnir in the process. Loki called Thor a traitor and Balder exiled him from Asgard.</p><br>
        <p>Thor then turned to Doctor Strange to help him restore Mjolnir. It was bonded to Thor's life force so that any injury to the hammer would affect Thor. It was then that Thor learned of Sif's fate, allowing him to restore her to her body. Sif, the Warriors Three, and Thor then chose to settle in exile in Broxton before Asgard was finally restored to its own realm.</p><br>
        <img src="images\t\tc6.jpg"><br>
        <p>Thor Odinson eventually became unworthy of Mjolnir and his former lover Jane Foster took up the mantle of Thor in his stead. Possessing all his godhood and powers via the hammer, she battled as the Goddess of Thunder. The Odinson, along with his new weapon, the battle ax Jarnbjorn, departed to fight across the realms on his own.</p><br>
        <p>When Jane Foster's cancer-ridden body could no longer take the rigors of godhood, she chose to battle a rampaging Mangog one last time in an effort to save Asgard from total destruction. In her final battle, she managed to defeat the monster, and allowed the Asgardian people time to escape the destruction. Jane Foster  then stepped down from the mantle, allowing the God of Thunder to serve as Thor once again.</p><br>
