        <h2>HULK</h2>
        <p>Dr. Bruce Banner lives a life caught between the soft-spoken scientist he’s always been and the uncontrollable green monster powered by his rage.</p><br>
        <p>HULK (BRUCE BANNER)</p>
        <p>Exposed to heavy doses of gamma radiation, scientist Bruce Banner transforms into the mean, green rage machine called the Hulk.</p><br>

        <h1>Not Easy Being Green</h1><br>
        <p>Bioscience genius Dr. Bruce Banner focused his major studies on the effects of gamma radiation on humans, working alongside Dr. Betty Ross at a Virginia University lab. Dr. Ross’ father, General “Thunderbolt” Ross of the U.S. Army, channeled Banner’s work into a program to develop weapons for the military, unbeknownst to both doctors. When Banner decided to test what he learned on himself, he triggered a fantastic transformation in himself that resulted in an immense, hulking figure fueled by his own rage.</p><br>
        <p>Having destroyed his lab as the creature, and inadvertently harming Ross in the process, Banner slipped away to avoid capture and study by the Army and began a desperate quest for a cure to his bizarre affliction.</p><br>
        <h1>Nobody Stronger</h1><br>
        <p>As intelligent and cerebral as Bruce Banner is, his alter-ego the Hulk is a completely physical phenomenon. The green behemoth possesses the greatest raw strength of any natural being on Earth, with an upper limit that has yet to be fully tested. His leg muscles allow him to leap great distances and land without harm, and his skin can resist damage from heavy weaponry, as well as the natural elements and even unnatural ones.</p><br>
        <p>The Hulk has grown somewhat more intelligent over the years, beginning with the mind of nearly an infant and progressing to what might be described as the personality of a toddler. His speech has increased from growls and roars, to one or two words at a time, to full sentences, albeit broken and naïve. Banner recognizes the Hulk as himself, but often refers to him as “the other guy,” while his alter-ego seems to have little love or respect for the mild scientist and may not even be cognizant that Banner is himself.</p><br>
        <img src="images\h\h1.jpg"><br>
        <p>The doctor transforms into the Hulk during moments of stress, anxiety, and most of all anger. The change can reverse itself if the Hulk reaches a state of calm, either by himself or through a special mantra utilized by his fellow Avengers, most notably Natasha Romanoff, the Black Widow.</p><br>
        <h1>Hulk Smash!</h1><br>
        <p>Since his battle with the Abomination on the streets of Harlem, New York, the Hulk has tested his mettle against a crop of powerful opponents while as an Avenger and on his own. These include the alien Chitauri forces and their flying leviathans, the Asgardian trickster Loki, the high-tech soldiers of Hydra, Iron Man’s powerful “Hulkbuster” armor, the robotic despot Ultron, and Thor himself in the Sakaarian arenas of the Grandmaster.</p><br>
        <p>While no physical match for the green giant, one might view General “Thunderbolt” Ross as the Hulk’s strongest and most persistent foe, in the sense of the man’s dogged pursuit of Banner and his alter-ego and his casual willingness to subvert the doctor’s life’s work into weaponry for the U. S. military. In terms of sheer power, the tyrant Thanos has given the Hulk a run for his money and bested him in direct combat.</p><br>
        <p>While the Hulk has faced strong foes before, none so definitively beat him in combat as Thanos, who was able to quickly subdue the jade giant when they fought. Hulk’s subsequent refusal to physical manifest himself may be due to that encounter, even as Bruce Banner continues the fight against Thanos and his followers.</p><br>
        <img src="images\h\h2.jpg"><br>
        <h1>Hulk Make Friend!</h1><br>
        <p>While at the university at which he did his initial gamma research, Bruce Banner was romantically involved with his partner, Dr. Betty Ross. After becoming the Hulk, he seemed to maintain his memory and knowledge of the relationship and gravitated toward Betty to protect her from harm. After the Hulk’s first real battle with another creature nearly as strong as himself, he was prevented from killing his foe by Betty and fled the area without her, which seems to have been the last time they were in contact.</p><br>
        <p>After allying himself with the Avengers, Banner entered into a complex romantic relationship with Natasha Romanoff, the master spy called the Black Widow. At first, Banner resisted his feelings for Romanoff, citing his inability to live a normal life as a reason to maintain a platonic partnership with her. The Black Widow convinced him otherwise and for a brief moment it seemed the two might find happiness together, before the Hulk decided to leave, likely reflecting Banner’s own concerns.</p><br>
        <p>Both Banner and the Hulk have witnessed a friendship flourish with the Asgardian Thor, a fellow Avenger. At first, the two struggled through violent clashes and petty arguments over who was the strongest, but these contests led to camaraderie during their time as enslaved gladiators on the planet Sakaar. In Thor, the Hulk may have finally found his truest companion.</p><br>
        <img src="images\h\h3.jpg"><br>
        <p>Tony Stark has also reached out to Bruce Banner as a peer in the realm of science, and as a man who suffers from a debilitation much like he himself once did. Together, the two have worked together on projects seemingly as one mind, though Banner has raised objections to what he feels are moral and ethical gaps in Stark’s push to advance technology.</p><br>
        <h1>Evergreen Adventures</h1><br>
        <p>Bruce Banner spent five years hiding from Ross and the army, until finally settling in Brazil to focus his search for a cure in plant research and mind-relaxing techniques. During this time, he communicated with cellular biologist Doctor Samuel Sterns back in the U.S., but the unintended transportation of Banner’s irradiated blood to a man in Milwaukee exposed his whereabouts to “Thunderbolt” Ross and his operative, Emil Blonsky. Banner reentered the country to try and recover his original research data from Culver University, but that meant the Hulk came with him and not even a reunion with Betty Ross could quell the angered beast.</p><br>
        <p>After making his way first to Smoky Mountains National Forest and then the steel canyons of New York, Bruce Banner was forced to pit his alter-ego against a gamma-transformed Blonsky, the duplicity of Dr. Sterns, and the ever-looming “Thunderbolt” Ross. The Hulk defeated Blonsky and moved in for the kill, but Betty Ross stopped him from crossing this line and he fled once again. Soon after, in seclusion, Banner began to try and gain more control over the Hulk.</p>
        <p>Sometime later, S.H.I.E.L.D.’s Nick Fury dispatched his operative Natasha Romanoff, the Black Widow, to approach Banner in India and convince him to join the so-called Avengers Initiative. Unfortunately, the team’s first mission, to prevent Loki’s despoiling of the planet with the mystical Tesseract device, brought the Hulk and his other potential teammates into the trickster’s crosshairs, resulting in a furious battle onboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier between Hulk and Thor. During that fight, the Hulk crashed down to Earth and transformed back into Banner, and then made his way back to New York. Explaining to his fellow Avengers that he was in fact always, on some level, angry, he was able to consciously transform into the Hulk to assist the Avengers in their fight against aliens brought to Earth by Loki’s machinations, and the would-be conquerors were ultimately defeated.</p><br>
        <img src="images\h\h4.jpg"><br>
        <p>Following the Avengers’ first victory, Banner spent time with Tony Stark for scientific pursuits and even acted as a sounding board for Stark to share his troubles with, after the billionaire suffered through post-traumatic stress disorder. With somewhat more say in the Hulk’s appearances, Banner joined the Avengers on missions to root out the terrorist organization Hydra around the globe, though he remained wary of his changes into the beast. The Avengers found that a certain lullaby, typically said by the Black Widow, was able to calm the Hulk and help him revert back to Banner, when the Hulk’s strength was no longer needed. During this time, Banner developed feelings for Natasha Romanoff, though he was also hesitant about beginning a romantic relationship, fearful of its potential pitfalls, given his situation.</p><br>
        <img src="images\h\h5.jpg"><br>
        <p>Banner initially expressed disapproval for Tony Stark’s desire to use a power source found in Loki’s scepter to develop a planet-wide security system. Those doubts were unfortunately proven right when he agreed to aid Stark in the project, only for the destructive robot known as Ultron to be born as a result. The situation brought even more challenges for Banner when a young woman named Wanda Maximoff, working with Ultron at the time, used her mind-warping abilities to send the Hulk on another, even more mindless rampage in South Africa, prompting Iron Man to utilize a special suit of armor crafted specifically for halting the green giant’s anger-fueled attack. Hiding out with the Avengers at Clint Barton AKA Hawkeye’s farm home after the South African incident, Banner and Romanoff discussed their burgeoning feelings and the possibility of leaving the team and going off together. However, after the Avengers defeated Ultron with the Hulk’s help, the Hulk himself, seemingly guided by Banner’s own regretful wishes, chose to remove himself from further harming his friends and the world around him. He refused to return to the team, including Natasha, and flew off in a Quinjet.</p><br>
        <img src="images\h\h6.jpg"><br>
        <p>Subsequently, a wormhole brought the Quinjet containing the Hulk to the far-off planet Sakaar. There he found what seemed a fitting place for a being such as himself—as a fighter in the Grandmaster’s gladiator arena. Besting all others in battle, he soon became the Grandmaster’s beloved champion and remained the Hulk at all times, never changing back into Bruce Banner. When his fellow Avenger Thor arrived on the planet and was forced into the arena as well, the Hulk was pitted against him. The fight that ensued ended somewhat indecisively for the satisfaction of either. In the aftermath of their fight, the Hulk, while bonding more with Thor, initially didn’t want to help his fellow Avenger in his plan to escape. When the Hulk attempted to stop Thor from using the Avengers Quinjet to leave Sakaar, a recording of Romanoff onboard made the creature transform back into Banner for the first time in two years.</p><br>
        <p>The Hulk had damaged the Quinjet beyond repair. So, Thor, aided by Loki, found another ship to leave Sakaar and return to his native Asgard to reclaim the throne from his older sister Hela, with Banner and the warrior Valkyrie accompanying him. Overcoming his concerns that transforming back into the Hulk could result in never returning to his human form, Banner chose to allow his alter-ego to resurface after Hela unleashed her giant wolf, Fenris, against the surviving Asgardians. As the Hulk, he defeated the huge animal. In the meantime, Thor put an end to Hela, albeit at the cost of Asgard itself. Upon Asgard’s destruction, the Hulk—still having not changed back into Banner—joined the remaining Asgardians on a space ship launched into the cosmos to find a new home. He was present as Thor accepted his new role as the leader of his people.</p><br>
        <img src="images\h\h7.jpg"><br>
        <p>The ship was discovered by the space tyrant Thanos soon after and he decimated the Asgardians to find the Infinity Stone Loki harbored. The Hulk attacked Thanos, but was bested by him in combat and then transported back to Earth by Heimdall’s last action.</p><br>
        <p>Crashing into Doctor Strange’s Sanctum in New York City, the Hulk changed back to Bruce Banner, who informed Strange, Wong, and Tony Stark of the tyrant’s intention to come to Earth to claim the Infinity Stones that were on the planet. When two of Thanos’ followers arrived to try and take the Infinity Stone in the possession of Doctor Strange, Banner found himself now unable to transform back into the Hulk at all—with the Hulk outright resisting any attempt to get him to manifest.</p><br>
        <img src="images\h\h8.jpg"><br>
        <p>When Iron Man was taken off planet, Banner called in Steve Rogers for help, and in doing so was reunited with Natasha Romanoff, along with several of his Avengers teammates. Banner then traveled with Cap and his crew to Wakanda to protect the Infinity Stone that gave the android Vision artificial life. There, he conferred with the brilliant inventor Shuri on how to remove the Stone and destroy it without harming Vision. To give Shuri time to perform the operation, Banner donned Stark’s “Hulkbuster” armor to fight alongside the Black Panther and his Wakandan army, along with his fellow Avengers, against an army of Thanos’ followers. However, when Thanos himself arrived and successfully claimed the last of the six Stones, the battle was lost. Half of all life in the universe disintegrated when the tyrant willed it to happen, leaving Banner and only a few remaining Avengers and allies to try to make sense of the tragedy.</p><br>

        <h1 style="background-color: seagreen;"><hr>HULK IN COMICS<hr></h1>
    </div>
    <DIV style="margin-left: 400px;">
        <h1>The Monster Inside</h1><br>
        <p>The child of an abusive father, Bruce Banner grew up shy and introverted, yet a scientific genius. As a young man, thanks to his standout work in the field of nuclear physics, he attracted the attention of the U.S. Army who wanted to adapt his theories for weaponry. Banner resisted such notions, but failed attempts at landing steady work convinced him to accept a position at a federal nuclear research facility at a missile base in the New Mexico desert.</p><br>
        <p>At the base, Banner was befriended by Betty Ross, daughter of General Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross, a man who took an instant disliking to the diminutive, passive scientist. While at the base, Banner began to develop and build a bomb that utilized a high concentration of gamma radiation, a project of high interest to an undercover foreign agent stationed there. When a teenager named Rick Jones wandered onto the test field just as Banner started the countdown for the gamma bomb’s initial test detonation, the scientist rushed out to the area to warn Jones, but the foreign agent purposefully continued the test. The bomb exploded, bathing Bruce Banner in its radiation.</p><br>
        <p>Incredibly, he survived the detonation, but later in the evening transformed into a large, grey, man-like monstrosity dubbed a “hulk” by one of the base’s soldiers.</p><br>
        <img src="images\h\hc1.jpg"><br>
        <p>Only Rick Jones witnessed the transformation, and perhaps out of a feeling of guilt over Banner’s exposure to the gamma rays shepherded the creature to a place of safety until it changed back into the scientist. Once realizing what had occurred, Banner accepted Jones’ help and began to work on a cure for his incredible situation in secret, but the Hulk—now with green skin, rather than grey—continued to emerge and quickly earned the enmity of General Ross.</p><br>
        <h1>Hulk-Out</h1><br>
        <p>Bruce Banner’s intelligence has made him one of the world’s leading authorities on nuclear physics, as well as other related disciplines, but these qualities become submerged normally upon his transformation into the monstrous Hulk, who exists as a physical extension of his pent-up rage and mental imbalance.</p><br>
        <p>The Hulk’s strength remains at the top level of all super human beings on Earth and increases exponentially as his anger grows. This strength grants him not only upper body prowess, but also the ability to leap great distances and land without harm to himself. The Hulk’s skin is nearly impenetrable and his lung capacity allows for long periods of submersion in water, exposure to many forms of gases, and even to temporary survival in the airless vacuum of outer space.</p><br>
        <img src="images\h\hc2.jpg"><br>
        <p>Banner’s transformations are usually triggered by adrenaline rushes when he becomes anxious, nervous, or angry, which lead to similar feelings in the Hulk. Normally, the scientist’s personality and intelligence give way to his alter-ego’s brutish mindset, creating what appears to be two different personas who seem to share only the singular desire to be left alone.</p><br>
        <h1>Friends of the Monster</h1><br>
        <p>Perhaps ironically, the Hulk has arguably made more friends and allies than Bruce Banner, some of them have even grown close to him and formed lasting bonds.</p><br>
        <img src="images\h\hc3.jpg"><br>
        <p>Betty Ross saw something in Bruce Banner from the moment they met at the New Mexico missile base and, despite her father’s objections, tried to understand the shy scientist. The Hulk noticed Betty early in his existence, most likely due to Banner’s own interest in the young woman, and after she learned of their dual identity, she began to sympathize with their plight. Bruce and Betty eventually married, but their happiness was short-lived due to the tribulations of the Hulk, leading to a rocky road for their relationship.</p><br>
        <p>Rick Jones’ presence at the missile base during Banner’s test of his gamma bomb may have paved the way to the creation of the Hulk, but the young man has more than made amends for it with his long friendship with both the scientist and the Hulk. In fact, in the early days of their bond, Jones became the only person who could calm the raging creature and help him return to Banner’s form. Jones came and went over the years following, owing to his own tumultuous life, but he somehow always gravitated back to the Hulk’s side to provide support and partnership.</p><br>
        <img src="images\h\hc4.jpg"><br>
        <p>In more recent times, boy genius Amadeus Cho has filled the role once played by Rick Jones, that of the Hulk’s companion and confidant. Cho stood with the beast through many hardships, and even became a Hulk himself after Banner’s apparent demise.</p><br>
        <p>Among the super human community, the Fantastic Four’s Ben Grimm, aka the Thing, and the X-Men’s Wolverine not only have battled the Hulk on numerous occasions, but also formed odd friendships with him, perhaps due to their own sense of isolation as oddities.</p><br>
        <img src="images\h\hc5.jpg"><br>
        <h1>Hatred for the Hulk</h1><br>
        <p>The Hulk’s frightening appearance, his destructive tendencies, and his defiance of being caged and studied has resulted in a long list of opponents and enemies throughout his time roaming the planet.</p><br>
        <p>Arguably his first enemy was “Thunderbolt” Ross, who made it his own personal crusade to track down, capture, and destroy the Hulk. This mission played out over many years in a cat-and-mouse game between the general, Bruce Banner, and his green alter-ego, to the point of many battles and wasted tax dollars in weaponry and equipment on Ross’ part. On an even more personal level, Ross could never understand or accept his daughter Betty’s love for the scientist and sympathy for his plight, leading to many clashes between the two over the years. Ironically, General Ross eventually became a Hulk, too, at a time when Banner’s own creature was nowhere to be seen.</p><br>
        <img src="images\h\hc6.jpg"><br>
        <p>Gamma radiation played a major role in the creation of two of the Hulk’s greatest opponents, the Leader and the Abomination, with the latter gaining heightened intelligence from the unique radiation, and the former transforming into a grotesque monster even more terrifying than the Hulk. The Leader proved the more persistent of the two foes, building scheme upon scheme to waylay and destroy his fellow gamma-spawned nemesis, even to the point of attempting to take over the Hulk’s body when his own was mortally damaged.</p><br>
        <p>Other recurring foes of the green giant include a possible future version of the Hulk known as the Maestro, the powerful Agamemnon and Achilles of the secretive Pantheon, the criminal U-Foes, and the gadget-laden Boomerang.</p><br>
        <h1>Way of the Wandering Warrior</h1><br>
        <p>While avoiding General Ross and the U.S. Army, the Hulk took on extra-normal opponents such as the wily Gargoyle and the subterranean Tyrannus as his transformations back and forth to Bruce Banner became less erratic and more stabilized. Eventually, the change into a now-green form would usually occur mostly due to Banner’s adrenaline rushes, something the worried scientist worked desperately to control while he hid his secret from the world.</p><br>
        <p>When the Asgardian god of mischief Loki sought to sow chaos for his half-brother Thor, he manipulated Hulk into a clash with Thor, Iron Man, Ant-Man, and the Wasp, though he only succeeded in the inadvertent creation of a new team of heroes, the Avengers. Suspicious of his teammates, the Hulk left very shortly after the team formed, and soon began an alliance with Namor the Sub-Mariner to oppose the Avengers. When that too fell apart, the green behemoth returned to his wanderings and infrequent battles with General Ross’ “Hulkbusters” fighting unit.</p><br>
        <p>Believing he operated in Banner’s best interests, Rick Jones revealed the scientist’s secret to Ross and his daughter Betty, and before long the public knew the truth of the connection between Banner and the Hulk. Banner subsequently proposed to Betty, but the Hulk came between them and the young woman went on to marry Bruce Talbot, one of her father’s army majors and a steadfast rival of Banner’s. The Hulk helped the mystic Dr. Strange and Namor defeat an otherworldly threat to the Earth and joined Strange’s loose “non-team” the Defenders for many adventures in the years to come alongside various teammates.</p><br>
        <img src="images\h\hc7.jpg"><br>
        <p>At one point, the Hulk was transported to another plane of existence, where he met the beautiful queen Jarella and fell in love with her. Then, back on Earth, Banner performed a blood transfusion on his wounded cousin Jennifer Walters, which caused her to change into a “She-Hulk,” and later Banner accepted the Hulk as an integral part of himself. When an accident allowed the Hulk to retain his alter-ego’s intelligence, the U.S. president pardoned the creature, until Banner once again lost control of his other self. Wandering once more, and near-mindless, the Hulk found himself at an other-dimensional crossroads, the result of Dr. Strange’s well-meaning spells, and entered into a new series of weird adventures there.</p><br>
        <p>Brought back to Earth accidentally by the Canadian super team Alpha Flight, the Hulk rampaged across the land before being separated into two wholly separate beings, himself and Bruce Banner. Believing a new future lay ahead of him, the scientist proposed again to the now-divorced Betty Ross, but their hopeful new wedded life fell quickly into chaos when the Hulk and Banner were reintegrated. After that, a strange, intelligent, and grey-skinned version of the Hulk—not unlike his first form— emerged to work as an enforcer nicknamed Mr. Fixit in Las Vegas for a time.</p><br>
        <p>The green Hulk eventually returned and due to the work of psychiatrist and fellow gamma-mutate Doc Samson, grew more intelligent. Now known as the Professor, this clever, smart Hulk met and joined the secretive group called the Pantheon, faced his own possible future-self, the Maestro, and reverted back to his more-brutish form when Banner received shrapnel close to his brain after an attack. The scientist also finally made peace with the ghost of his abusive father after the mutant Apocalypse removed a dangerous shard in his head and his beloved Betty seemingly died.</p><br>
        <p>A revived Betty came to Banner in the guise of the mysterious “Mr. Blue” to teach her husband self-hypnosis to help him control the inner Hulk. The Leader framed the green giant for murder, prompting Banner to hit the road and avoid the gamma villain’s bid to insert his own mind into the Hulk’s body. Another gamma bomb explosion temporarily resurrected the grey Hulk, and a collection of the smartest heroes on Earth called the Illuminati shot the Hulk into space for permanent exile, but a space warp transported him to the far-flung planet Sakaar where he became a popular warrior, and eventually the world’s ruler.</p><br>
        <p>Lasting happiness on Sakaar eluded the Hulk when the power cell in his spaceship exploded and decimated a large portion of the planet, along with his queen. Returning to Earth for revenge on the Illuminati, the Hulk went on a rampage until Iron Man devised a way to transform the behemoth back into Bruce Banner and hold him in stasis. During this time, the Hulk was befriended by boy genius Amadeus Cho, and Banner witnessed the advent of both a new Red Hulk (secretly “Thunderbolt” Ross) and Rick Jones’ transformation into the blue beast called A-Bomb. The original Hulk finally returned to put all newcomers in their place, as well as to deal with the arrival of his son Skaar from Sakaar and Betty as a Red She-Hulk.</p><br>
        <img src="images\h\hc8.jpg"><br>
        <p>Doctor Doom managed to separate Banner and his alter-ego once again, and the now-insane scientist sequestered himself on a remote island where he waged a private war on the Hulk. When the two were finally recombined, the Hulk joined the spy organization S.H.I.E.L.D. and after being healed of a head wound by Iron Man’s Extremis formula, manifested yet another new personality, Doc Green. Intelligent again, the Hulk decided to rid the world of all gamma-mutates—including his own cousin, She-Hulk—by taking back the radiation’s effects. However, when Amadeus Cho absorbed his own gamma-powers, the boy became the new Hulk.</p><br>
        <p>Guilt-ridden from all the hurt his alter-ego delivered to the world, Banner placed himself into seclusion until drawn from it by another “civil war” between Earth’s champions over an Inhuman with visions of the future. One such vision illustrated the Hulk’s eventual destruction of numerous heroes, but when Iron Man and others confronted Banner to take him into their custody, the archer Hawkeye subverted their intentions and killed the scientist with an arrow through his brain.</p><br>
        <p>Later, the nefarious Hand ninja clan stole Banner’s body to resurrect it for their own purposes, and mad bio-engineer Arnim Zola subsequently revived the Hulk for another temporary rampage during Hydra’s recent takeover of the United States.</p><br>
